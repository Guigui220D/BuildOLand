# BuildOLand

BuildOLand is a 2d topview multiplayer building game!
You can build, destroy things, play with your friend, etc...

Buildoland is still being developped, the main difficulty being the multiplayer mode currently.
We are constantly adding features, but we don't recomment downloading it now to play it, as it contains bugs, test features, some things may not work, so wait for the first release that we should release this year :)

There is an old version of this game that Guigui220D made, that is technically functionnal, but awfully coded, and gave it up a long time ago.
